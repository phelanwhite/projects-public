  Think about all the cave paintings that still make sense of what they are about.
  <br/>
  Or the first images you created as a child, haphazardly drawing with multiple crayons on a blank canvas when you did not yet know how to speak.
  <br/>
  Sketching somehow preserves and propagates knowledge like text never can.
  <br/>
  This was an important insight that stuck with the researchers of a recent pre-print on ArXiv.
  <br/>
  They introduced a framework called Sketchpad, which gives multi-modal LLMs a visual sketchpad and the tools to draw on it.
  <br/>
  The framework allows these LLMs to draw intermediary sketches to boost their reasoning ability when prompted.
  <br/>
  And yes, it works wonders!
  <br/>
  Sketchpad significantly enhances task performance compared to other LLMs that do not utilize sketching…

    I love reading.
    <br/>
    Reading is the best habit you can build to boost every part of your life.
    <br/>
    I don’t mind reading an ebook, but I prefer a physical book.
    <br/>
    The smell of new pages is magical.
    <br/>
    But who has the time to sit down with a book in this highly distracted world where social media, especially video culture, is everywhere?
    <br/>
    People (adults) spend almost 2 to 3 hours a day on smartphones and television.
    <br/>
    Before continuing with this article, check your screen time. You will be surprised to learn how much time you waste daily by doing nothing on your smartphone except aimlessly scrolling.
    <br/>
    What if you gave some of that time to books?
    <br/>
    Today, I am going to share how reading can benefit you.
    <br/>
    A couple of weeks ago, I wrote an article about how reading affects your brain, which went viral. Here are the articles if you would like to know more.

    How Does Reading Affect Your Brain
